# Ainari - Ryokan

Image-service of Ainari: upload, conversion and encryption of VM-images.

> **IMPORTANT:** Ainari is still a prototype and NOT ready for any productive usage.

## About

Ryokan manages the Onsen storage-hosts. Images for new virtual machines are uploaded over Ryokan,
converted and encrypted with a key of Omamori, before they are stored in the Onsen.

It is one component of [Ainari](https://github.com/kitsudaiki/ainari), a secure and easy to use,
deploy and develop IaaS stack to manage virtual machines.

## Image

The image is built `FROM scratch` with [nix](https://nixos.org): it contains only the pinned
runtime-packages of the component and its binary, no shell-tools for debugging. The list of all
packages is in `/etc/nix-packages.txt` of the image:

```bash
docker run --rm --entrypoint cat kitsudaiki/ryokan:develop /etc/nix-packages.txt
```

The container runs as the non-root user `ainari` (uid `1000`).
